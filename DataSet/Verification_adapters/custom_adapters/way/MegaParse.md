Based on the provided API documentation for the `MegaParse` class, here is the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions:
There are no top-level functions mentioned in the provided documentation. All functions are methods belonging to the `MegaParse` class.

### Methods:
All methods listed are instance methods belonging to the `MegaParse` class. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. **`__init__`**:
   - **Belongs to**: `MegaParse`
   - **Type**: Instance Method

2. **`validate_input`**:
   - **Belongs to**: `MegaParse`
   - **Type**: Instance Method

3. **`extract_page_strategies`**:
   - **Belongs to**: `MegaParse`
   - **Type**: Instance Method

4. **`load`**:
   - **Belongs to**: `MegaParse`
   - **Type**: Instance Method

5. **`aload`**:
   - **Belongs to**: `MegaParse`
   - **Type**: Instance Method

### Total Number of Interface Classes:
There is **1 interface class** mentioned in the documentation, which is the `MegaParse` class.

Here are the answers to your questions regarding how to fill in the `CustomAdapter` class based on the provided template and the interface documentation:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
In the `create_interface_objects` method, you need to initialize the following interface class objects based on the documentation provided:

- **`MegaParse`**: This is the primary interface class mentioned in the documentation. You will need to create an instance of `MegaParse` using the parameters passed in `kwargs`.

If there are no other interface classes mentioned in the documentation, then only the `MegaParse` class object needs to be initialized. If there are additional interface classes that are relevant to your implementation, those should also be initialized accordingly.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
According to the interface documentation provided, there are no top-level functions mentioned. Therefore, no top-level functions need to be mapped to the `run` method of the `CustomAdapter`.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
Based on the methods provided in the interface documentation for the `MegaParse` class, the following should be mapped to the `run` method in the `CustomAdapter`:

1. **`load`**: This should be mapped as `run('load', **kwargs)`. It is an instance method of the `MegaParse` class.

2. **`aload`**: This should be mapped as `run('aload', **kwargs)`. This is also an instance method of the `MegaParse` class.

3. **`validate_input`**: This should be mapped as `run('validate_input', **kwargs)`. It is another instance method of the `MegaParse` class.

4. **`extract_page_strategies`**: This should be mapped as `run('extract_page_strategies', **kwargs)`. This is an instance method of the `MegaParse` class.

5. **`__init__`**: This method is the constructor and should not be mapped to `run`, as it is automatically called when creating an instance of the `MegaParse` class.

In summary, for the methods of the `MegaParse` class, you will use the following mappings in the `run` method:
- `run('load', **kwargs)`
- `run('aload', **kwargs)`
- `run('validate_input', **kwargs)`
- `run('extract_page_strategies', **kwargs)`

If there are any class methods or static methods in the `MegaParse` class that are not mentioned in the documentation, they should also be considered for mapping if applicable. However, based on the information provided, only the instance methods listed above are relevant to the `run` method.
