Based on the provided API documentation for the `SARIMAModel`, here is the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
- There are no top-level functions explicitly defined in the provided documentation.

### Methods
1. **`__init__`**
   - **Class**: `SARIMAModel`
   - **Type**: Instance method

2. **`fit`**
   - **Class**: `SARIMAModel`
   - **Type**: Instance method

3. **`predict`**
   - **Class**: `SARIMAModel`
   - **Type**: Instance method

4. **`get_parameter_search_space`**
   - **Class**: `SARIMAModel`
   - **Type**: Instance method

### Total Number of Interface Classes
- There is **1 interface class**, which is `SARIMAModel`. 

In summary, there are no top-level functions, four instance methods belonging to the `SARIMAModel` class, and a total of one interface class.

Certainly! Here are the answers to your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (For top-level functions, initialization is not needed)

In the provided `SARIMAModel` documentation, there is one interface class, which is `SARIMAModel`. Therefore, in the `create_interface_objects` method of `CustomAdapter`, you need to initialize an object of the `SARIMAModel` class. This initialization is necessary since the methods of this class will be invoked later in the `run` method.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?

There are no top-level functions explicitly defined in the provided documentation for `SARIMAModel`. Therefore, there are no top-level functions to be mapped in the `run` method of `CustomAdapter`.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)

The following methods from the `SARIMAModel` class should be mapped to the `run` method of `CustomAdapter`:

1. **Instance Methods:**
   - `fit`: This should be mapped as `run('fit', **kwargs)`.
   - `predict`: This should be mapped as `run('predict', **kwargs)`.
   - `get_parameter_search_space`: This should be mapped as `run('get_parameter_search_space', **kwargs)`.

Since there is only one interface class (`SARIMAModel`), you can directly use the method names without prefixing them with the class name in the `run` method.

In summary:
- Initialize an object of `SARIMAModel` in `create_interface_objects`.
- No top-level functions to map.
- Map the instance methods `fit`, `predict`, and `get_parameter_search_space` directly in `run` as `run('fit', **kwargs)`, `run('predict', **kwargs)`, and `run('get_parameter_search_space', **kwargs)`, respectively.
