Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
1. **`search`**: This is a top-level function that performs a search operation based on the provided parameters.
2. **`add`**: This is another top-level function responsible for adding data to a specified dataset.

### Methods
There are no specific interface classes or methods defined in the provided documentation. The functions `search` and `add` do not appear to belong to any class based on the information given.

### Summary
- **Total Number of Top-Level Functions**: 2 (search, add)
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 0 (no interface classes are defined in the provided documentation)

If there are any additional classes or methods that are not included in the provided documentation, please provide that information for further classification.

Let's address your questions one by one based on the provided interface documentation.

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in create_interface_objects, or is initialization unnecessary? (For top-level functions, initialization is not needed)

In the provided documentation, there are no specific interface classes mentioned. The functions `search` and `add` are top-level functions, meaning they do not require object initialization within the `create_interface_objects` method. Therefore, you can conclude that initialization of interface class objects is unnecessary for this case.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?

The top-level functions from the interface documentation that should be mapped to the `run` method are:
- `search`: This can be mapped to `run('search', **kwargs)`.
- `add`: This can be mapped to `run('add', **kwargs)`.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)

Based on the provided documentation, there are no specific instance methods, class methods, or static methods mentioned that belong to any particular interface class. The only methods implied are the top-level functions `search` and `add`. Therefore, you would not need to map any additional methods beyond the top-level functions.

To summarize:
- **Top-Level Functions to Map in `run`:**
  - `search`: `run('search', **kwargs)`
  - `add`: `run('add', **kwargs)`

- **No additional instance methods, class methods, or static methods need to be mapped.**

This should help you fill in the `CustomAdapter` implementation based on the requirements outlined in the template.
