Based on the provided API documentation for the `PdfConverter` class, here is the classification of the elements:

### Top-Level Functions
- There are no top-level functions explicitly mentioned in the provided documentation. All functions listed are methods belonging to the `PdfConverter` class.

### Methods
1. **Method: `__init__`**
   - **Class**: `PdfConverter`
   - **Type**: Instance method

2. **Method: `build_document`**
   - **Class**: `PdfConverter`
   - **Type**: Instance method

3. **Method: `__call__`**
   - **Class**: `PdfConverter`
   - **Type**: Instance method

### Total Number of Interface Classes
- There is **1 interface class** mentioned in the documentation, which is the `PdfConverter` class.

### Summary
- **Top-Level Functions**: 0
- **Methods**: 3 (all instance methods of the `PdfConverter` class)
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 1 (PdfConverter)

Sure! Let's address your questions one by one based on the provided template and the interface documentation for `PdfConverter`.

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (for top-level functions, initialization is not needed)

In the `create_interface_objects` method, you will need to initialize an instance of the `PdfConverter` class. This is the only interface class mentioned in the documentation, so it is necessary to create an object of this class to use its methods in the `run` method. 

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?

There are no top-level functions explicitly mentioned in the provided interface documentation. Therefore, you do not need to map any top-level functions in the `run` method.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)

Based on the provided interface documentation for the `PdfConverter` class, the following methods should be mapped to the `run` method:

1. **Instance Methods**:
   - `build_document`: This method can be called directly on the `PdfConverter` instance, so it would be mapped as `run('build_document', **kwargs)`.

2. **Magic Method**:
   - `__call__`: This method allows the `PdfConverter` instance to be called as a function, so it can be mapped as `run('__call__', **kwargs)`.

Since there is only one interface class (`PdfConverter`), you can use the method names directly without prefixing them with the class name.

### Summary:
- **Q1**: Initialize an instance of `PdfConverter` in `create_interface_objects`.
- **Q2**: No top-level functions to map.
- **Q3**: Map `build_document` and `__call__` methods to `run`.
