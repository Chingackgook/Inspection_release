To classify the functions and methods based on the provided API documentation, we can break down the information as follows:

### Top-Level Functions
The following functions are identified as top-level functions since they are not defined within any class:

1. `file_paths`
2. `specify_file_paths`
3. `plan`
4. `generate_code`
5. `generate_code_sync`

### Methods and Their Classes
Since the provided documentation does not specify any classes or methods belonging to classes, I cannot identify any methods or their corresponding classes. If there are any classes in your implementation that are not included in the provided documentation, please share them so I can assist in identifying the methods and their classifications.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
Based on the provided documentation, there are **0 classes** mentioned. If there are classes in your implementation that have not been included in the API documentation, please provide that information for a more accurate count.

### Summary
- **Top-Level Functions**: 5
- **Methods**: None identified (due to lack of class information)
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 0 (based on the provided documentation)

If you have additional information about classes or methods, please provide that, and I can help further.

Certainly! Here are the answers to your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (For top-level functions, initialization is not needed)
In the context of your API documentation, since all the functions listed (`file_paths`, `specify_file_paths`, `plan`, `generate_code`, and `generate_code_sync`) are top-level functions, there is no need to initialize any interface class objects in `create_interface_objects`. Initialization is only necessary if there are specific interface classes that encapsulate functionality related to these functions, which is not indicated in the provided documentation.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
The following top-level functions should be mapped to the `run` method in `CustomAdapter`:
- `file_paths` → `run('file_paths', **kwargs)`
- `specify_file_paths` → `run('specify_file_paths', **kwargs)`
- `plan` → `run('plan', **kwargs)`
- `generate_code` → `run('generate_code', **kwargs)`
- `generate_code_sync` → `run('generate_code_sync', **kwargs)`

Each of these top-level functions can be invoked directly within the `run` method using the appropriate `dispatch_key`.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)
Based on the provided documentation, there are no specific instance methods, class methods, or static methods explicitly mentioned that correspond to any classes. However, if we consider the possibility that the functions might be part of a class (e.g., if you had an interface class that encapsulates the functionality), you would map them as follows:

- If there were an interface class (let's hypothetically call it `CodeGenerator`), you might have methods like:
  - `CodeGenerator.file_paths` (static method) → `run('CodeGenerator_file_paths', **kwargs)`
  - `CodeGenerator.specify_file_paths` (static method) → `run('CodeGenerator_specify_file_paths', **kwargs)`
  - `CodeGenerator.plan` (static method) → `run('CodeGenerator_plan', **kwargs)`
  - `CodeGenerator.generate_code` (instance method) → `run('CodeGenerator_generate_code', **kwargs)`
  - `CodeGenerator.generate_code_sync` (instance method) → `run('CodeGenerator_generate_code_sync', **kwargs)`

However, since the documentation does not specify any classes or methods other than the top-level functions, you would primarily focus on mapping the top-level functions as mentioned in Q2.

### Summary
- **Q1**: No interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`.
- **Q2**: Map all top-level functions to `run`.
- **Q3**: No specific instance, class, or static methods are mentioned in the documentation to be mapped to `run`. Focus on the top-level functions instead. 

If there are any additional classes or methods in your implementation that were not included in the documentation, please provide that information for a more precise mapping.
