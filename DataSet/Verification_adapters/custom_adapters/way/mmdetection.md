Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of top-level functions and methods, along with their respective classes and types:

### Top-Level Functions
There are no explicit top-level functions mentioned in the provided documentation. All functions are methods belonging to the `DetInferencer` class.

### Methods and Their Classification
All the following methods belong to the `DetInferencer` class and are instance methods (i.e., they operate on instances of the class):

1. **`__init__`**
   - Class: `DetInferencer`
   - Type: Instance Method

2. **`preprocess`**
   - Class: `DetInferencer`
   - Type: Instance Method

3. **`__call__`**
   - Class: `DetInferencer`
   - Type: Instance Method

4. **`visualize`**
   - Class: `DetInferencer`
   - Type: Instance Method

5. **`postprocess`**
   - Class: `DetInferencer`
   - Type: Instance Method

6. **`pred2dict`**
   - Class: `DetInferencer`
   - Type: Instance Method

### Total Number of Interface Classes
There is a total of **1 interface class**, which is `DetInferencer`.

Sure! Here are the answers to your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (For top-level functions, initialization is not needed)
In the provided interface documentation, there is only one interface class: `DetInferencer`. Therefore, you need to initialize an object of `DetInferencer` in the `create_interface_objects` method. The initialization is necessary because you will be calling its methods in the `run` method. 

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
There are no explicit top-level functions mentioned in the provided interface documentation. Therefore, there are no top-level functions to map to the `run` method.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)
The following methods from the `DetInferencer` class should be mapped to `run`:

1. **Instance Methods:**
   - `preprocess`: Map as `run('preprocess', **kwargs)`.
   - `__call__`: Map as `run('__call__', **kwargs)`.
   - `visualize`: Map as `run('visualize', **kwargs)`.
   - `postprocess`: Map as `run('postprocess', **kwargs)`.
   - `pred2dict`: Map as `run('pred2dict', **kwargs)`.

Since there is only one interface class (`DetInferencer`), you can directly use the method names in the `run` method mapping. 

### Summary
- In `create_interface_objects`, initialize an instance of `DetInferencer`.
- There are no top-level functions to map to `run`.
- Map the instance methods of `DetInferencer` to the `run` method using their respective names.
