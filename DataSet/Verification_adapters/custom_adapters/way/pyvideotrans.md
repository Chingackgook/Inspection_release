Based on the provided documentation, the classification of functions and methods is as follows:

### Top-Level Functions
- `speech_to_text`: This is a top-level function that is not part of any class.

### Methods
There are no methods mentioned in the provided documentation. The only function described is the `speech_to_text` function, which is a standalone top-level function.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
The provided documentation does not mention any interface classes. Therefore, the total number of interface classes is **0**.

### Summary
- **Top-Level Functions**: 1 (`speech_to_text`)
- **Methods**: 0
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 0

Let's address each of your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
Since the documentation provided does not specify any interface classes, and the only top-level function is `speech_to_text`, there is no need to initialize any interface class objects in `create_interface_objects`. Therefore, initialization is unnecessary.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
The only top-level function mentioned in the interface documentation is `speech_to_text`. This function should be mapped to `run` with the following mapping:
- `run('speech_to_text', **kwargs)`

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
Based on the provided documentation, there are no instance methods, class methods, or static methods defined for any interface classes because no classes are mentioned. The only function to be mapped remains the top-level function:
- `run('speech_to_text', **kwargs)`

In summary:
- No interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`.
- The top-level function `speech_to_text` should be mapped to `run`.
- There are no instance, class, or static methods to map to `run` since no classes were provided in the documentation. 

This means that the implementation of `CustomAdapter` will primarily focus on invoking the `speech_to_text` function in the `run` method without needing to create any class instances.
