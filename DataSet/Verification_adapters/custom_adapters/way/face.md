Based on your provided API documentation, the functions can be classified as follows:

### Top-Level Functions
These functions are defined at the top level and are not associated with any class:
1. `face_distance`
2. `load_image_file`
3. `face_locations`
4. `batch_face_locations`
5. `face_landmarks`
6. `face_encodings`
7. `compare_faces`

### Class Methods
There are no class methods mentioned in the provided documentation. Therefore, there are no methods that belong to a specific class.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
Based on the provided documentation, there are **0 interface classes** mentioned.

In summary:
- **Top-Level Functions**: 7
- **Class Methods**: 0
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 0

Let's address each question one by one based on the provided interface documentation.

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
In your provided documentation, there are no specific interface classes mentioned, only top-level functions. Therefore, you do not need to initialize any interface class objects in the `create_interface_objects` method. Initialization is unnecessary since the functions can be called directly without creating instances of any classes.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
The top-level functions that should be mapped to `run` are:
1. `face_distance`
2. `load_image_file`
3. `face_locations`
4. `batch_face_locations`
5. `face_landmarks`
6. `face_encodings`
7. `compare_faces`

You can map these functions to the `run` method using the form `run(function_name, **kwargs)`.

### Q3: Which class methods should be mapped to `run`?
As per the provided interface documentation, there are no class methods mentioned. Therefore, there are no class methods to map to `run`. If you were to have class methods in the future, they would be mapped to the `run` method using the form `run(class_name_method_name, **kwargs)`.

### Summary
- **Q1**: No interface class objects need initialization; it's unnecessary.
- **Q2**: Map the top-level functions `face_distance`, `load_image_file`, `face_locations`, `batch_face_locations`, `face_landmarks`, `face_encodings`, and `compare_faces` to `run`.
- **Q3**: There are no class methods to map to `run`. 

This will help you fill in the `CustomAdapter` class accordingly, implementing the `create_interface_objects` and `run` methods based on the answers to these questions.
