Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
The following functions are identified as top-level functions:
1. `generate_audio`
2. `text_to_semantic`
3. `semantic_to_waveform`
4. `save_as_prompt`

### Methods
There are no methods specified in the provided documentation. All functions appear to be standalone and do not belong to any class as instance methods, class methods, or static methods.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
The documentation does not mention any interface classes. Therefore, the total number of interface classes is **0**. 

In summary:
- **Top-Level Functions**: 4
- **Methods**: 0
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 0

Sure! Here are the answers to your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
Based on the interface documentation provided, there are no interface classes mentioned, only top-level functions. Therefore, initialization of interface class objects is unnecessary in the `create_interface_objects` method. You can leave this method empty or implement it to handle any necessary default logic if required.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
The following top-level functions from the interface documentation should be mapped to the `run` method:
1. `generate_audio`
2. `text_to_semantic`
3. `semantic_to_waveform`
4. `save_as_prompt`

In the `run` method, you would implement mappings like:
- `run('generate_audio', **kwargs)`
- `run('text_to_semantic', **kwargs)`
- `run('semantic_to_waveform', **kwargs)`
- `run('save_as_prompt', **kwargs)`

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
Since the provided documentation does not specify any classes with instance methods, class methods, or static methods, there are no methods to map in this category. All functions are top-level functions, and as such, they do not require any additional mapping for instance methods or class methods.

In summary:
- **Q1**: No interface class objects need to be initialized.
- **Q2**: Map the top-level functions `generate_audio`, `text_to_semantic`, `semantic_to_waveform`, and `save_as_prompt` in `run`.
- **Q3**: No instance methods, class methods, or static methods to map, as there are no classes defined in the documentation.
