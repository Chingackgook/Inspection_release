Based on the provided documentation, here is the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
1. `safe_get_memory_info`: A top-level function that retrieves memory usage information.
2. `force_cleanup`: A top-level function that performs a forced cleanup of memory.

### Methods
1. **Class: `MangaTranslatorLocal`**
   - `__init__(self, params: dict = None)`: Instance method.
   - `translate_path(self, path: str, dest: str = None, params: dict[str, Union[int, str]] = None)`: Instance method.
   - `translate_file(self, path: str, dest: str, params: dict, config: Config)`: Instance method.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
- There is **1 interface class**: `MangaTranslatorLocal`. 

### Summary
- **Top-Level Functions**: 2
- **Methods**: 3 (all instance methods of the `MangaTranslatorLocal` class)
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 1

Here are the answers to your questions regarding how to fill in the `CustomAdapter` class based on the provided template:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
In the `create_interface_objects` method, you need to initialize an object for the `MangaTranslatorLocal` class. This is necessary because the methods of this class will be called in the `run` method. If there are no other interface classes mentioned in the documentation, you don't need to initialize any additional objects.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
The top-level functions that should be mapped to `run` are:
1. `safe_get_memory_info`: This function can be called directly using the `run` method.
2. `force_cleanup`: This function can also be called directly using the `run` method.

You would map these functions to the following dispatch keys:
- `run('safe_get_memory_info', **kwargs)`
- `run('force_cleanup', **kwargs)`

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
For the `MangaTranslatorLocal` class, you will need to map the following instance methods:
1. `translate_path(self, path: str, dest: str = None, params: dict[str, Union[int, str]] = None)`: This method can be called using the dispatch key `translate_path`.
2. `translate_file(self, path: str, dest: str, params: dict, config: Config)`: This method can be called using the dispatch key `translate_file`.

Since there is only one interface class (`MangaTranslatorLocal`), you can directly map these methods as follows:
- `run('translate_path', **kwargs)`
- `run('translate_file', **kwargs)`

### Summary
- **Initialization in `create_interface_objects`**: Initialize `MangaTranslatorLocal`.
- **Top-level functions in `run`**: Map `safe_get_memory_info` and `force_cleanup`.
- **Instance methods in `run`**: Map `translate_path` and `translate_file` from the `MangaTranslatorLocal` class.
