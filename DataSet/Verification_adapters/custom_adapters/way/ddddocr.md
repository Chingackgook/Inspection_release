Based on the provided API documentation, here's the classification of the components:

### Top-Level Functions
There are no top-level functions explicitly defined in the provided documentation. All functions listed are methods belonging to the `OCREngine` class.

### Methods and Their Class Associations
1. **`__init__`**
   - Class: `OCREngine`
   - Type: Instance Method

2. **`initialize`**
   - Class: `OCREngine`
   - Type: Instance Method

3. **`predict`**
   - Class: `OCREngine`
   - Type: Instance Method

4. **`set_charset_range`**
   - Class: `OCREngine`
   - Type: Instance Method

5. **`get_charset`**
   - Class: `OCREngine`
   - Type: Instance Method

### Total Number of Interface Classes
There is a total of **1 interface class**, which is `OCREngine`.

Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided interface documentation:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
In the `create_interface_objects` method, you need to initialize an instance of the `OCREngine` class. Since this is the only interface class mentioned in the documentation, you will create an object of `OCREngine` and store it in an attribute of your `CustomAdapter`. Initialization is necessary to facilitate the execution of its methods in the `run` method.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
There are no top-level functions mentioned in the interface documentation that need to be mapped to the `run` method. All functionalities are encapsulated within the `OCREngine` class methods.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
The following methods from the `OCREngine` class should be mapped to the `run` method:

1. **Instance Methods:**
   - `initialize` should be mapped as `run('initialize', **kwargs)`.
   - `predict` should be mapped as `run('predict', **kwargs)`.
   - `set_charset_range` should be mapped as `run('set_charset_range', **kwargs)`.
   - `get_charset` should be mapped as `run('get_charset', **kwargs)`.

Since there is only one interface class (`OCREngine`), you can directly use the method names in the `run` method without needing to prefix them with the class name.
