Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of the components:

### Top-Level Functions
1. `request_gpt_model_in_new_thread_with_ui_alive`

### Methods
- There are no specific methods mentioned in the provided documentation. If there were methods, they would need to be categorized based on their respective classes. For now, we only have the top-level function.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
- The documentation does not specify any interface classes. Therefore, the total number of interface classes is **0**.

If there are additional parts of the documentation that include interface classes or methods, please provide that information for a more comprehensive classification.

Let's address your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
Based on the provided API documentation, there are no specific interface classes mentioned that require initialization. Since the only function listed is a top-level function (`request_gpt_model_in_new_thread_with_ui_alive`), initialization of any interface class objects is unnecessary in this case. If there were interface classes defined in the documentation, you would typically create instances of those classes based on their names and parameters provided in `kwargs`.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
The only top-level function mentioned in the interface documentation is `request_gpt_model_in_new_thread_with_ui_alive`. This function should be mapped to the `run` method in the `CustomAdapter` class. Therefore, you would implement a case in the `run` method such that when the `dispatch_key` is `request_gpt_model_in_new_thread_with_ui_alive`, the corresponding logic to call this function is executed.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
The documentation does not specify any instance methods, class methods, or static methods belonging to any interface classes. Therefore, there are no methods to map to the `run` method in the `CustomAdapter` class. If there were additional classes and their respective methods defined in the documentation, you would map them in the `run` method using the format:

- For instance methods: `run(class_name_method_name, **kwargs)`
- For class methods: `run(class_name_class_method_name, **kwargs)`
- For static methods: `run(class_name_static_method_name, **kwargs)`

Since the provided documentation does not include such methods, you will only need to implement the mapping for the top-level function noted in Q2. 

In summary:
1. No initialization of interface class objects is needed.
2. Map `request_gpt_model_in_new_thread_with_ui_alive` to `run`.
3. No instance, class, or static methods need to be mapped since none are specified in the documentation.
