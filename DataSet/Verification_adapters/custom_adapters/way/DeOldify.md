Based on the provided documentation, here is the classification of the top-level functions and methods, including their associated classes and types:

### Top-Level Functions
- **`get_watermarked`**: This is a top-level function that generates a watermarked version of a given PIL image.

### Methods and Their Classes
1. **Class: `ModelImageVisualizer`**
   - **Method: `__init__`**
     - Type: Instance Method
   - **Method: `plot_transformed_image_from_url`**
     - Type: Instance Method
   - **Method: `plot_transformed_image`**
     - Type: Instance Method
   - **Method: `get_transformed_image`**
     - Type: Instance Method

### Total Number of Interface Classes
- There is a total of **1 interface class**: `ModelImageVisualizer`. 

In summary:
- **Top-Level Functions**: 1
- **Methods**: 4 (all instance methods of `ModelImageVisualizer`)
- **Total Interface Classes**: 1

Let's go through your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (for top-level functions, initialization is not needed)

In the provided interface documentation, there is one interface class: `ModelImageVisualizer`. Therefore, you will need to create an instance of `ModelImageVisualizer` in the `create_interface_objects` method. You do not need to initialize any objects for the top-level function `get_watermarked`, as it is not part of a class and does not require instantiation.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?

The only top-level function mentioned in the documentation is `get_watermarked`. Therefore, you should map this function to the `run` method using the following dispatch key:

- `run('get_watermarked', **kwargs)`

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)

For the `ModelImageVisualizer` class, you will map the following instance methods to the `run` method:

1. **Instance Methods**:
   - `plot_transformed_image_from_url`: This should be mapped as:
     - `run('plot_transformed_image_from_url', **kwargs)`
   - `plot_transformed_image`: This should be mapped as:
     - `run('plot_transformed_image', **kwargs)`
   - `get_transformed_image`: This should be mapped as:
     - `run('get_transformed_image', **kwargs)`

Since there is only one interface class (`ModelImageVisualizer`), you can directly use the method names without needing to prepend the class name.

### Summary

1. **Q1**: Initialize an object of `ModelImageVisualizer` in `create_interface_objects`.
2. **Q2**: Map `get_watermarked` to `run` as `run('get_watermarked', **kwargs)`.
3. **Q3**: Map the instance methods `plot_transformed_image_from_url`, `plot_transformed_image`, and `get_transformed_image` to `run` as `run('plot_transformed_image_from_url', **kwargs)`, `run('plot_transformed_image', **kwargs)`, and `run('get_transformed_image', **kwargs)` respectively.
