Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
- There are no top-level functions listed in the provided documentation.

### Methods and Their Classes
All methods belong to the `Memory` class. Here’s the classification of each method:

1. **Instance Methods:**
   - `__init__(self, config: MemoryConfig = MemoryConfig())`
   - `add(self, messages, user_id=None, agent_id=None, run_id=None, metadata=None, filters=None, infer=True, memory_type=None, prompt=None)`
   - `get(self, memory_id)`
   - `get_all(self, user_id=None, agent_id=None, run_id=None, limit=100)`
   - `search(self, query, user_id=None, agent_id=None, run_id=None, limit=100, filters=None)`
   - `update(self, memory_id, data)`
   - `delete(self, memory_id)`
   - `delete_all(self, user_id=None, agent_id=None, run_id=None)`
   - `history(self, memory_id)`
   - `reset(self)`
   - `chat(self, query)`

2. **Class Methods:**
   - `from_config(cls, config_dict: Dict[str, Any])`

### Total Number of Interface Classes
- There is **1 interface class**: `Memory`.

Sure! Here’s how to fill in the template based on the provided interface documentation, answering your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (For top-level functions, initialization is not needed.)
In the `create_interface_objects` method, you need to initialize an object of the `Memory` class, which is the only interface class mentioned in the documentation. This object will be used to call the methods defined in the `Memory` class. You do not need to initialize any objects for top-level functions since they don’t require instantiation.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
There are no top-level functions mentioned in the provided interface documentation. Therefore, no mappings for top-level functions are needed in the `run` method.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit class methods or static methods; they should also be mapped to `run`.)
The following methods from the `Memory` class should be mapped to the `run` method:

1. **Instance Methods:**
   - `add`: This should be mapped as `run('add', **kwargs)`.
   - `get`: This should be mapped as `run('get', **kwargs)`.
   - `get_all`: This should be mapped as `run('get_all', **kwargs)`.
   - `search`: This should be mapped as `run('search', **kwargs)`.
   - `update`: This should be mapped as `run('update', **kwargs)`.
   - `delete`: This should be mapped as `run('delete', **kwargs)`.
   - `delete_all`: This should be mapped as `run('delete_all', **kwargs)`.
   - `history`: This should be mapped as `run('history', **kwargs)`.
   - `reset`: This should be mapped as `run('reset', **kwargs)`.
   - `chat`: This should be mapped as `run('chat', **kwargs)`.

2. **Class Methods:**
   - `from_config`: This should be mapped as `run('from_config', **kwargs)`.

There are no static methods mentioned in the provided interface documentation, so no mappings for static methods are needed.

### Summary of Mappings for `run`
- For instance methods: `run('method_name', **kwargs)`
- For class methods: `run('from_config', **kwargs)`

This structure allows you to execute the appropriate method based on the `dispatch_key` provided when calling the `run` method in your `CustomAdapter`.
