Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
1. `alpha_matting_cutout`
2. `naive_cutout`
3. `get_model`
4. `remove`
5. `iter_frames`
6. `remove_many`

### Methods
1. **Class: `Net`**
   - Method: `__init__` (Instance Method)
   - Method: `forward` (Instance Method)

### Summary
- Total Number of Interface Classes: **1** (The `Net` class)

Here are the answers to your questions regarding how to fill in the `CustomAdapter` class based on the provided template and interface documentation:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
In the provided interface documentation, there is only one interface class, which is `Net`. Therefore, you need to initialize an instance of the `Net` class inside the `create_interface_objects` method. You can use the `interface_class_name` parameter to determine which model to load (e.g., `"u2net"`, `"u2netp"`, or `"u2net_human_seg"`). If the `interface_class_name` is not specified, you might create a default instance of `Net` with a default model name.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
The following top-level functions should be mapped to the `run` method:
1. `alpha_matting_cutout`
2. `naive_cutout`
3. `get_model`
4. `remove`
5. `iter_frames`
6. `remove_many`

In the `run` method, you would use the `dispatch_key` to determine which of these functions to call, passing `**kwargs` as the parameters for the function.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
The instance methods that should be mapped to `run` are the methods from the `Net` class:
1. `__init__`: This is called when creating an instance of the `Net` class and does not need to be mapped in `run`.
2. `forward`: This method can be mapped as `run('Net_forward', **kwargs)`.

The mapping for the `run` method would look like this:
- For the top-level functions: `run(function_name, **kwargs)`
- For the `forward` method of the `Net` class: `run('Net_forward', **kwargs)`

If there are any static or class methods in the `Net` class or any other classes that are relevant to your implementation, they should also be mapped similarly based on their names and how they are intended to be used.

### Summary
- **Initialize `Net` class** in `create_interface_objects`.
- **Map top-level functions** directly to `run`.
- **Map `forward` method** of `Net` as `run('Net_forward', **kwargs)`.
