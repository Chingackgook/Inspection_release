Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of the components:

### Top-Level Functions
There are no explicit top-level functions mentioned in the provided documentation. All functions are methods belonging to classes.

### Methods and Their Classification
1. **Method: `__init__`**
   - **Class**: `FaceAlignment`
   - **Type**: Instance Method

2. **Method: `get_landmarks`**
   - **Class**: `FaceAlignment`
   - **Type**: Instance Method

3. **Method: `get_landmarks_from_image`**
   - **Class**: `FaceAlignment`
   - **Type**: Instance Method

4. **Method: `get_landmarks_from_batch`**
   - **Class**: `FaceAlignment`
   - **Type**: Instance Method

5. **Method: `get_landmarks_from_directory`**
   - **Class**: `FaceAlignment`
   - **Type**: Instance Method

### Total Number of Interface Classes
There are a total of **3 interface classes**:
1. `LandmarksType`
2. `NetworkSize`
3. `FaceAlignment`

Let's address your questions one by one based on the provided template and the interface documentation.

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
You need to initialize an object for the `FaceAlignment` class in the `create_interface_objects` method. This is the only interface class mentioned in the documentation, so you will create an instance of `FaceAlignment` using the provided `kwargs` when the `interface_class_name` matches it. Initialization for the other classes (`LandmarksType` and `NetworkSize`) is unnecessary, as they are enumeration classes and do not require instantiation.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
There are no top-level functions mentioned in the interface documentation, so there are no top-level functions to map to the `run` method.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
You should map the following methods from the `FaceAlignment` class:

1. **Instance Methods**:
   - `get_landmarks_from_image`: This method should be mapped as `run('get_landmarks_from_image', **kwargs)`.
   - `get_landmarks_from_batch`: This method should be mapped as `run('get_landmarks_from_batch', **kwargs)`.
   - `get_landmarks_from_directory`: This method should be mapped as `run('get_landmarks_from_directory', **kwargs)`.

2. **Deprecated Instance Method**:
   - `get_landmarks`: Although it is deprecated, you may still want to map it for backward compatibility if necessary. This can be mapped as `run('get_landmarks', **kwargs)`.

In summary, the `run` method will handle the execution of these methods based on the `dispatch_key` provided, allowing you to call them with the appropriate arguments passed through `kwargs`.
