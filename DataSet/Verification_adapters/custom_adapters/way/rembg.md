Based on the provided API documentation for the `remove()` function, it appears that there is only one top-level function described, which is the `remove()` function itself. 

### Classification:

1. **Top-Level Functions:**
   - `remove()`

2. **Methods:**
   - There are no methods explicitly mentioned in the provided documentation. If there are other methods in the interface documentation that you haven't shared, please provide them for classification. 

3. **Total Number of Interface Classes:**
   - The documentation does not specify any interface classes. If there are additional classes in the interface documentation that you have not included, please provide that information for an accurate count.

### Summary:
- **Total Top-Level Functions:** 1 (remove)
- **Total Methods:** 0 (none specified)
- **Total Number of Interface Classes:** 0 (none specified)

If you have more details or additional parts of the documentation, please share them for a more comprehensive analysis.

Let's address your questions one by one based on the provided template and interface documentation.

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?

In the context of the provided interface documentation for the `remove()` function, there are no specific classes mentioned that need to be instantiated. The `remove()` function is a top-level function, which means it does not require initialization of any class objects. 

However, if there are any specific classes related to the background removal process that are not mentioned in the documentation but are part of the implementation, those would need to be initialized. If the documentation does not specify any such classes, then initialization is unnecessary.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?

The top-level function provided in the interface documentation that should be mapped to `run` is:

- `remove`

This function can be invoked in the `run` method as `run('remove', **kwargs)`.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?

Based on the documentation provided, there are no specific instance methods, class methods, or static methods mentioned that need to be mapped to `run`. However, if there are any classes related to the `remove()` function that have methods associated with them, those methods should be mapped accordingly.

Since the only method mentioned in the documentation is `remove`, you would not need to map any additional methods unless specified. 

If there are other classes or methods in the broader context of the application that are relevant, they would need to be identified and mapped as follows:
- For instance methods: `run('class_name_method_name', **kwargs)`
- For class/static methods: `run('class_name_static_method_name', **kwargs)`

In summary:
- **Top-Level Function to Map in `run`:** `remove`
- **Instance/Static Methods to Map in `run`:** None specified in the provided documentation.

If additional classes and methods are part of your implementation but not included in the provided documentation, please identify them for a more comprehensive mapping.
