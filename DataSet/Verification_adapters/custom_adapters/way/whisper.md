Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
These functions are defined at the top level and are not part of any class:
1. `available_models()`
2. `load_model(name: str, device: Optional[Union[str, torch.device]] = None, download_root: str = None, in_memory: bool = False) -> Whisper`
3. `transcribe(model: "Whisper", audio: Union[str, np.ndarray, torch.Tensor], *, ...) -> dict`
4. `cli()`

### Methods
There are no methods specified in the provided API documentation. All functions are defined as top-level functions, and there are no classes or methods associated with any classes mentioned.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
The documentation does not mention any interface classes. Therefore, the total number of interface classes is **0**.

### Summary
- **Top-Level Functions**: 4
- **Methods**: 0
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 0

If there are any additional classes or methods you would like to include or clarify, please provide that information for further classification.

Certainly! Letâ€™s address your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (For top-level functions, initialization is not needed)

In the provided API documentation, there are no interface classes mentioned, only top-level functions. Therefore, initialization of interface class objects in `create_interface_objects` is unnecessary. You can skip this step in your `CustomAdapter` implementation.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?

The following top-level functions from the API documentation should be mapped to the `run` method in your `CustomAdapter`:

1. `available_models` - This can be called with `dispatch_key` as `'available_models'`.
2. `load_model` - This can be called with `dispatch_key` as `'load_model'`.
3. `transcribe` - This can be called with `dispatch_key` as `'transcribe'`.
4. `cli` - Since this function is intended to be run from the command line, it may not be necessary to include in the `run` method.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit class methods or static methods; they should also be mapped to `run`)

The provided API documentation does not specify any classes with instance methods, class methods, or static methods. Therefore, there are no methods to map to the `run` method in your `CustomAdapter`.

### Summary
- **Q1**: No interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`.
- **Q2**: Map the following top-level functions to `run`:
  - `available_models` as `run('available_models', **kwargs)`
  - `load_model` as `run('load_model', **kwargs)`
  - `transcribe` as `run('transcribe', **kwargs)`
- **Q3**: There are no instance methods, class methods, or static methods to map to `run`.

With this information, you can proceed to implement the `CustomAdapter` class by filling in the `create_interface_objects` and `run` methods accordingly.
