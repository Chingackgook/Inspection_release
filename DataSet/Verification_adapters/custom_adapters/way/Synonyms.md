Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
These functions are not part of any class and can be called directly:
1. `keywords`
2. `sv`
3. `bow`
4. `v`
5. `nearby`
6. `compare`
7. `describe`
8. `display`
9. `main`

### Methods
Since the documentation does not specify any classes or their methods, it appears that all the functions listed are top-level functions. Therefore, there are no methods to classify into instance methods, class methods, or static methods.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
Based on the provided documentation, there are **0 interface classes** mentioned. All functions appear to be standalone without any associated classes.

### Summary
- **Top-Level Functions**: 9
- **Methods**: 0
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 0

Let's address your questions one by one.

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
For the provided API documentation, all functions are top-level functions and do not require initialization of any interface class objects. Therefore, no initialization is necessary in the `create_interface_objects` method.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
The following top-level functions from the interface documentation should be mapped to the `run` method:
1. `keywords`
2. `sv`
3. `bow`
4. `v`
5. `nearby`
6. `compare`
7. `describe`
8. `display`
9. `main`

These functions can be called directly from the `run` method using the `dispatch_key` corresponding to each function name.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
Since the provided documentation does not mention any specific classes with instance methods, class methods, or static methods, there are no methods to map in this regard. All the functions listed above are top-level functions, and there are no associated instance or class methods to implement.

### Summary
- **Q1**: No initialization of interface class objects is needed in `create_interface_objects`.
- **Q2**: Map all top-level functions (`keywords`, `sv`, `bow`, `v`, `nearby`, `compare`, `describe`, `display`, `main`) to `run`.
- **Q3**: No instance methods, class methods, or static methods to map, as all functions are top-level functions.
