Based on the provided API documentation, hereâ€™s the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
1. **`glob_images`**: This is a top-level function that retrieves image files from a specified path.
2. **`batch_inpaint`**: This is also a top-level function that performs inpainting on a batch of images.

### Methods
The provided documentation does not specify any classes or methods within classes. Therefore, we can conclude that there are no methods mentioned, and thus no classes to associate methods with. 

### Summary
- **Total Number of Top-Level Functions**: 2
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 0 (since no classes are mentioned in the provided documentation)

If you have additional documentation that includes classes and methods, please provide that for a more detailed classification.

Let's address each question one by one based on the provided template and interface documentation.

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
- In the provided interface documentation, there are no classes mentioned that require the creation of objects. Both `glob_images` and `batch_inpaint` are top-level functions, so you do not need to initialize any interface class objects in the `create_interface_objects` method. Therefore, initialization is unnecessary.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
- The top-level functions from the interface documentation that should be mapped to `run` are:
  1. **`glob_images`**: This function can be called using the dispatch key `glob_images`.
  2. **`batch_inpaint`**: This function can be called using the dispatch key `batch_inpaint`.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
- According to the provided interface documentation, there are no instance methods, class methods, or static methods mentioned. The only functions provided are the top-level functions `glob_images` and `batch_inpaint`. Therefore, there are no methods to map for classes, as none are defined in the documentation.

### Summary of Mappings:
- **Top-Level Functions**:
  - `run('glob_images', **kwargs)`
  - `run('batch_inpaint', **kwargs)`

- **No class methods or instance methods to map** since no classes are defined in the documentation. 

This means your `CustomAdapter` will primarily focus on implementing the `run` method to handle the top-level function calls based on the provided `dispatch_key`.
