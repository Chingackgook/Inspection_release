Based on the provided API documentation, hereâ€™s the classification of functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
1. `get_predictor() -> Model`
2. `clear_predictor() -> None`
3. `predict_frame(target_frame: Frame) -> bool`
4. `predict_image(target_path: str) -> bool`
5. `predict_video(target_path: str) -> bool`

### Methods
- There are no methods specified in the provided documentation. All functions are defined as top-level functions without being associated with a class.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
- The documentation does not mention any interface classes explicitly. Therefore, based on the information provided, the total number of interface classes is **0**.

If there are any specific classes or methods that you intended to include but were not present in the documentation, please provide that information for a more accurate classification.

Certainly! Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided template and interface documentation:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
For the provided API documentation, there are no interface classes mentioned that require initialization. All functions are top-level functions, meaning they can be called directly without needing to create instances of any classes. Therefore, initialization is unnecessary in the `create_interface_objects` method.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
The following top-level functions from the interface documentation should be mapped to the `run` method:
1. `clear_predictor()`
2. `predict_frame(target_frame: Frame)`
3. `predict_image(target_path: str)`
4. `predict_video(target_path: str)`

These functions can be called directly within the `run` method using their names as the `dispatch_key`.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`?
Based on the provided documentation, there are no instance methods, class methods, or static methods defined within any classes. The functions listed in the interface documentation are all top-level functions. Therefore, there are no additional methods to map to `run`.

### Summary
- **Q1**: No initialization needed for interface class objects in `create_interface_objects`.
- **Q2**: Map the following top-level functions in `run`: `clear_predictor`, `predict_frame`, `predict_image`, `predict_video`.
- **Q3**: No instance methods, class methods, or static methods to map; only top-level functions are relevant. 

This information should guide you in implementing the `CustomAdapter` class based on the provided template.
