Based on the provided API documentation, here's the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
These functions are standalone and not part of any class:
1. `parse_range`
2. `parse_vec2`
3. `make_transform`
4. `generate_images`

### Methods
There are no methods specified in the provided documentation. All the functions listed above are top-level functions without any association with a class. Therefore, there are no instance methods, static methods, or class methods to classify.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
The documentation does not mention any specific interface classes. Therefore, the total number of interface classes is **0**.

### Summary
- **Top-Level Functions**: 4 (`parse_range`, `parse_vec2`, `make_transform`, `generate_images`)
- **Methods**: None
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 0

Based on the provided template and the interface documentation, here are the answers to your questions:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (For top-level functions, initialization is not needed)
In the provided documentation, there are no interface classes mentioned; all the functions are top-level functions. Therefore, initialization of interface class objects is unnecessary in `create_interface_objects`. You can simply leave this method as a placeholder or provide a comment indicating that no interface objects need to be created.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
The following top-level functions from the documentation should be mapped to the `run` method:
1. `parse_range`: This should be mapped to `run('parse_range', **kwargs)`.
2. `parse_vec2`: This should be mapped to `run('parse_vec2', **kwargs)`.
3. `make_transform`: This should be mapped to `run('make_transform', **kwargs)`.
4. `generate_images`: This should be mapped to `run('generate_images', **kwargs)`.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)
The provided documentation does not describe any instance methods, class methods, or static methods associated with any classes. Therefore, there are no methods to map to `run` in the context of the given interface documentation.

### Summary
- **Q1**: No interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects` since all functions are top-level.
- **Q2**: Map the following top-level functions in `run`:
  - `parse_range`
  - `parse_vec2`
  - `make_transform`
  - `generate_images`
- **Q3**: There are no instance methods, class methods, or static methods to map in `run` based on the provided documentation.
