Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
These functions are defined at the top level and are not part of any class:
1. `options()`
2. `mask_postprocess(mask, thres=20)`
3. `trans_image(image)`
4. `obtain_seq_index(index, num_frames)`
5. `transform_semantic(semantic, frame_index, crop_norm_ratio=None)`
6. `find_crop_norm_ratio(source_coeff, target_coeffs)`
7. `get_smoothened_boxes(boxes, T)`
8. `face_detect(images, args, jaw_correction=False, detector=None)`
9. `split_coeff(coeffs)`
10. `Laplacian_Pyramid_Blending_with_mask(A, B, m, num_levels=6)`
11. `load_model(args, device)`
12. `normalize_kp(kp_source, kp_driving, kp_driving_initial, adapt_movement_scale=False, use_relative_movement=False, use_relative_jacobian=False)`
13. `load_face3d_net(ckpt_path, device)`

### Methods
There are no methods specified in the provided documentation. Therefore, there are no classes or methods to classify.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
The documentation does not mention any interface classes. Therefore, the total number of interface classes is **0**.

Let's break down the questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (For top-level functions, initialization is not needed)

Based on the provided interface documentation, there are no classes mentioned that would require initialization. All the listed functions are top-level functions that do not belong to any specific class. Therefore, initialization of interface class objects in `create_interface_objects` is unnecessary.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?

The following top-level functions from the interface documentation should be mapped to the `run` method:

1. `options()`
2. `mask_postprocess(mask, thres=20)`
3. `trans_image(image)`
4. `obtain_seq_index(index, num_frames)`
5. `transform_semantic(semantic, frame_index, crop_norm_ratio=None)`
6. `find_crop_norm_ratio(source_coeff, target_coeffs)`
7. `get_smoothened_boxes(boxes, T)`
8. `face_detect(images, args, jaw_correction=False, detector=None)`
9. `split_coeff(coeffs)`
10. `Laplacian_Pyramid_Blending_with_mask(A, B, m, num_levels=6)`
11. `load_model(args, device)`
12. `normalize_kp(kp_source, kp_driving, kp_driving_initial, adapt_movement_scale=False, use_relative_movement=False, use_relative_jacobian=False)`
13. `load_face3d_net(ckpt_path, device)`

These functions can be called directly in the `run` method using their names as the `dispatch_key`.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)

Based on the provided documentation, there are no instance methods, class methods, or static methods defined within any classes. The functions listed are all top-level functions, and there are no methods associated with any classes to be mapped.

In summary, only the top-level functions need to be mapped in the `run` method, and there are no class or instance methods to consider for mapping.
