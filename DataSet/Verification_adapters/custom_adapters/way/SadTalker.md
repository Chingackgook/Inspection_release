Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of the interfaces:

### Top-Level Functions
- `load_cpk`: This is a top-level function that is not part of any class.

### Methods
1. **Class: `Audio2Coeff`**
   - **Method: `__init__`**
     - Type: Instance method
   - **Method: `generate`**
     - Type: Instance method
   - **Method: `using_refpose`**
     - Type: Instance method

### Summary
- Total number of interface classes: **1** (`Audio2Coeff`)

Let's address your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (For top-level functions, initialization is not needed)

In the provided interface documentation, there is one interface class: `Audio2Coeff`. Therefore, you will need to initialize an object of this class in the `create_interface_objects` method. You should create an instance of `Audio2Coeff`, passing in the necessary parameters from `kwargs`, which will include the required paths for model configurations and checkpoints.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?

The only top-level function provided in the interface documentation is `load_cpk`. You should map this function in the `run` method using the dispatch key corresponding to the function name. For example, you would implement a case for `dispatch_key == 'load_cpk'` in the `run` method, where you would call `load_cpk(**kwargs)`.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)

The interface class `Audio2Coeff` has the following instance methods that should be mapped in the `run` method:

1. **Instance Method: `generate`**
   - This should be mapped using a dispatch key like `dispatch_key == 'generate'`. You will call the `generate` method on the initialized `Audio2Coeff` object, passing `**kwargs` as arguments.

2. **Instance Method: `using_refpose`**
   - This should be mapped using a dispatch key like `dispatch_key == 'using_refpose'`. Similar to `generate`, you will call the `using_refpose` method on the `Audio2Coeff` object.

In summary, for the `run` method, you will have:
- A case for `load_cpk` (top-level function).
- A case for `generate` (instance method of `Audio2Coeff`).
- A case for `using_refpose` (instance method of `Audio2Coeff`).

This structure will allow you to handle both the top-level function and the instance methods effectively in the `run` method.
