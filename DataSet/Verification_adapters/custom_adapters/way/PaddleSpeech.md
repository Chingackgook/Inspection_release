Based on the provided documentation, here is the classification of the interfaces:

### Top-Level Functions
There are no explicitly defined top-level functions in the provided documentation. All functions are methods belonging to specific classes.

### Methods and Their Classification

1. **Class: ASRExecutor**
   - `__init__`: Instance method
   - `preprocess`: Instance method
   - `infer`: Instance method
   - `postprocess`: Instance method
   - `download_lm`: Instance method
   - `execute`: Instance method
   - `__call__`: Instance method

2. **Class: TextExecutor**
   - `__init__`: Instance method
   - `preprocess`: Instance method
   - `infer`: Instance method
   - `postprocess`: Instance method
   - `execute`: Instance method
   - `__call__`: Instance method

### Total Number of Interface Classes
There are a total of **2 interface classes**:
1. `ASRExecutor`
2. `TextExecutor`

Sure! Here are the answers to your questions, one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (for top-level functions, initialization is not needed)

In the `create_interface_objects` method, you need to initialize the following interface class objects:

1. **ASRExecutor**: This class is responsible for executing Automatic Speech Recognition tasks. You should create an instance of this class.

2. **TextExecutor**: This class is responsible for executing text processing tasks, specifically for punctuation restoration. You should also create an instance of this class.

Initialization is necessary for both classes because their methods will be invoked later in the `run` method.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?

There are no top-level functions mentioned in the provided interface documentation. Therefore, there are no top-level functions to map to the `run` method.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)

In the `run` method, you should map the following methods from the interface classes:

1. **From ASRExecutor**:
   - `execute`: This method should be mapped as `run('ASRExecutor_execute', **kwargs)` or simply `run('execute', **kwargs)` if you choose to use the method directly since there are two interface classes.
   - `__call__`: This method should be mapped as `run('ASRExecutor___call__', **kwargs)`.

2. **From TextExecutor**:
   - `execute`: This method should be mapped as `run('TextExecutor_execute', **kwargs)` or simply `run('execute', **kwargs)` if you choose to use the method directly since there are two interface classes.
   - `__call__`: This method should be mapped as `run('TextExecutor___call__', **kwargs)`.

### Summary of Mappings
- **Initialization in `create_interface_objects`**:
  - `ASRExecutor`
  - `TextExecutor`

- **Mappings in `run`**:
  - `run('ASRExecutor_execute', **kwargs)`
  - `run('ASRExecutor___call__', **kwargs)`
  - `run('TextExecutor_execute', **kwargs)`
  - `run('TextExecutor___call__', **kwargs)` 

This structure will allow the `CustomAdapter` class to properly initialize the necessary interface objects and execute the correct methods based on the `dispatch_key`.
