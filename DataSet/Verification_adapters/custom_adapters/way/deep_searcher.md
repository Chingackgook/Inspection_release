Based on the provided API documentation, here is the classification of the functions and methods:

### Top-Level Functions
1. `query`
2. `retrieve`
3. `naive_retrieve`
4. `naive_rag_query`

### Methods
There are no methods specified in the provided documentation, as it does not mention any classes or their associated methods. Therefore, there are no instance methods, class methods, or static methods to classify.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
The provided documentation does not include any information about interface classes. Therefore, the total number of interface classes is **0**.

### Summary
- **Top-Level Functions**: 4
- **Methods**: 0
- **Total Number of Interface Classes**: 0

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary? (For top-level functions, initialization is not needed)

In the provided API documentation, there are no interface classes specified; only top-level functions are mentioned. Therefore, initialization of interface class objects is unnecessary in `create_interface_objects`. The `create_interface_objects` method can remain empty or be designed to handle potential future interface classes, but as of now, it does not require any initialization.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?

The top-level functions that should be mapped to `run` are:

1. `query`
2. `retrieve`
3. `naive_retrieve`
4. `naive_rag_query`

These functions can be invoked directly in the `run` method using the `dispatch_key` that corresponds to each function name.

### Q3: Which instance methods, class methods, or static methods should be mapped to `run`? (Do not omit methods that the documentation mentioned)

The provided documentation does not specify any instance methods, class methods, or static methods associated with a class. Therefore, there are no methods to be mapped to `run` in this case. 

However, if we consider the potential for a future implementation where classes may be defined, you could map methods from those classes if they were to be included. The current implementation should focus solely on the top-level functions as outlined in Q2.

### Summary
- **Q1**: No interface class objects need to be initialized; initialization is unnecessary.
- **Q2**: Map the following top-level functions to `run`: `query`, `retrieve`, `naive_retrieve`, `naive_rag_query`.
- **Q3**: No instance methods, class methods, or static methods need to be mapped since none are specified in the documentation.
