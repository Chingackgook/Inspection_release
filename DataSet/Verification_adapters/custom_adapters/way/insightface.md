Based on the provided documentation for the `FaceAnalysis` class, here is the classification of the methods and functions:

### Top-Level Functions
- None specified in the provided documentation.

### Class Methods
1. **FaceAnalysis Class**
   - **`__init__`**: Initializes the `FaceAnalysis` class, loading the necessary models for face analysis.
   - **`prepare`**: Prepares the models for inference by setting the detection threshold and input size.
   - **`get`**: Detects faces in the provided image and retrieves face information, including bounding boxes and keypoints.
   - **`draw_on`**: Draws bounding boxes and keypoints on the detected faces in the image.

### Total Number of Interface Classes
- **1** (The `FaceAnalysis` class is the only class mentioned in the documentation.)

Let's address your questions one by one:

### Q1: Which interface class objects need to be initialized in `create_interface_objects`, or is initialization unnecessary?
In the provided documentation, there is only one interface class, which is `FaceAnalysis`. Therefore, you need to initialize an object of the `FaceAnalysis` class in the `create_interface_objects` method. You do not need to initialize any objects for top-level functions since they do not require instantiation.

### Q2: Which top-level functions should be mapped to `run`?
There are no top-level functions specified in the provided interface documentation. Therefore, you do not need to map any top-level functions in the `run` method.

### Q3: Which class methods should be mapped to `run`?
The methods of the `FaceAnalysis` class that should be mapped to the `run` method are:
1. `prepare`: This can be mapped as `run('prepare', **kwargs)`.
2. `get`: This can be mapped as `run('get', **kwargs)`.
3. `draw_on`: This can be mapped as `run('draw_on', **kwargs)`.

If you only have the `FaceAnalysis` class, you can directly map these methods in the form of `run(method_name, **kwargs)` since there is only one interface class. 

In summary:
- Initialize a `FaceAnalysis` object in `create_interface_objects`.
- No top-level functions to map.
- Map the class methods `prepare`, `get`, and `draw_on` in the `run` method as described.
