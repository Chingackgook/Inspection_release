# API Documentation for Wav2Lip

## Class: Wav2Lip

The `Wav2Lip` class implements a neural network model for lip synchronization based on audio input. It encodes audio sequences and facial sequences to generate synchronized lip movements.

### Attributes:
- `face_encoder_blocks`: A `ModuleList` containing sequential blocks of convolutional layers for encoding facial features.
- `audio_encoder`: A sequential block of convolutional layers for encoding audio features.
- `face_decoder_blocks`: A `ModuleList` containing sequential blocks of transposed convolutional layers for decoding facial features.
- `output_block`: A sequential block of convolutional layers that produces the final output of the model.

### Method: `__init__`

#### Description:
Initializes the Wav2Lip model by setting up the encoder and decoder blocks.

#### Parameters:
- None

#### Return Value:
- None

#### Purpose:
To create an instance of the Wav2Lip model and initialize its layers.

### Method: `forward`

#### Description:
Performs a forward pass through the model, taking audio and facial sequences as input and producing synchronized lip movement outputs.

#### Parameters:
- `audio_sequences` (Tensor): A tensor of shape `(B, T, 1, 80, 16)` where:
  - `B` is the batch size.
  - `T` is the number of time steps.
  - The last two dimensions represent the audio features.
  
- `face_sequences` (Tensor): A tensor of shape `(B, C, H, W)` where:
  - `B` is the batch size.
  - `C` is the number of channels (typically 3 for RGB).
  - `H` and `W` are the height and width of the facial images.

#### Return Value:
- `outputs` (Tensor): A tensor of shape `(B, C, T, H, W)` if `face_sequences` has more than 4 dimensions, or `(B, C, H, W)` otherwise, where:
  - `C` is the number of output channels (3 for RGB).
  - `T` is the number of time steps (for the output sequence).
  - `H` and `W` are the height and width of the output images.

#### Purpose:
To generate synchronized lip movements based on the provided audio and facial sequences by passing them through the model's encoder and decoder architecture.

#### Parameter Value Ranges:
- `audio_sequences`: Must be a 5D tensor with dimensions as specified above.
- `face_sequences`: Must be a 4D or 5D tensor with dimensions as specified above.
