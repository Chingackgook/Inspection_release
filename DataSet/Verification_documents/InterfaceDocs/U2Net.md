## Class: U2NET

### Description
The `U2NET` class implements the U2NET architecture, which is designed for image segmentation tasks. It utilizes a series of residual U-blocks (RSU) to extract features at multiple scales and produces side outputs for improved segmentation accuracy.

### Attributes
- **stage1**: An instance of `RSU7`, which processes the input image with 3 input channels and outputs 64 feature maps.
- **pool12**: A max pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions by half.
- **stage2**: An instance of `RSU6`, which processes the output from stage 1.
- **pool23**: A max pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions by half.
- **stage3**: An instance of `RSU5`, which processes the output from stage 2.
- **pool34**: A max pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions by half.
- **stage4**: An instance of `RSU4`, which processes the output from stage 3.
- **pool45**: A max pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions by half.
- **stage5**: An instance of `RSU4F`, which processes the output from stage 4.
- **pool56**: A max pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions by half.
- **stage6**: An instance of `RSU4F`, which processes the output from stage 5.
- **stage5d**: An instance of `RSU4F`, which is part of the decoder.
- **stage4d**: An instance of `RSU4`, which is part of the decoder.
- **stage3d**: An instance of `RSU5`, which is part of the decoder.
- **stage2d**: An instance of `RSU6`, which is part of the decoder.
- **stage1d**: An instance of `RSU7`, which is part of the decoder.
- **side1**: A convolutional layer that produces the first side output.
- **side2**: A convolutional layer that produces the second side output.
- **side3**: A convolutional layer that produces the third side output.
- **side4**: A convolutional layer that produces the fourth side output.
- **side5**: A convolutional layer that produces the fifth side output.
- **side6**: A convolutional layer that produces the sixth side output.
- **outconv**: A convolutional layer that combines all side outputs into a final output.

### Methods

#### `__init__(self, in_ch=3, out_ch=1)`

**Parameters:**
- `in_ch` (int, optional): The number of input channels. Default is 3 (for RGB images). Must be greater than 0.
- `out_ch` (int, optional): The number of output channels. Default is 1 (for binary segmentation). Must be greater than 0.

**Returns:**
- None

**Description:**
Initializes the U2NET model with specified input and output channels. It sets up the various stages of the network, including the encoder and decoder parts, as well as the side output layers.

#### `forward(self, x)`

**Parameters:**
- `x` (torch.Tensor): The input tensor of shape (N, C, H, W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of input channels, H is the height, and W is the width. The input tensor must have the same number of channels as specified by `in_ch`.

**Returns:**
- Tuple of torch.Tensor: A tuple containing:
  - `d0` (torch.Tensor): The final output of shape (N, out_ch, H, W), representing the segmentation map.
  - `d1` (torch.Tensor): The first side output of shape (N, out_ch, H, W).
  - `d2` (torch.Tensor): The second side output of shape (N, out_ch, H, W).
  - `d3` (torch.Tensor): The third side output of shape (N, out_ch, H, W).
  - `d4` (torch.Tensor): The fourth side output of shape (N, out_ch, H, W).
  - `d5` (torch.Tensor): The fifth side output of shape (N, out_ch, H, W).
  - `d6` (torch.Tensor): The sixth side output of shape (N, out_ch, H, W).

**Description:**
Defines the forward pass of the U2NET model. It takes an input tensor, processes it through the encoder and decoder stages, and produces the final segmentation output along with intermediate side outputs. The outputs are passed through a sigmoid activation function to produce values in the range [0, 1].
