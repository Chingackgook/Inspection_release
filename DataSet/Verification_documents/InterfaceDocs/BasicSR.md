# API Documentation for BasicVSR

## Class: BasicVSR

### Description
`BasicVSR` is a recurrent neural network designed for video super-resolution (SR). It currently supports a scale factor of 4x. The model utilizes optical flow for alignment and employs residual blocks for feature propagation and reconstruction.

### Attributes
- **num_feat (int)**: The number of feature channels. Default is 64.
- **spynet (SpyNet)**: An instance of the SPyNet class used for optical flow estimation.
- **backward_trunk (ConvResidualBlocks)**: A series of residual blocks for processing features in the backward direction.
- **forward_trunk (ConvResidualBlocks)**: A series of residual blocks for processing features in the forward direction.
- **fusion (nn.Conv2d)**: A convolutional layer that fuses features from both branches.
- **upconv1 (nn.Conv2d)**: A convolutional layer for upsampling the feature maps.
- **upconv2 (nn.Conv2d)**: Another convolutional layer for further upsampling.
- **conv_hr (nn.Conv2d)**: A convolutional layer for refining high-resolution features.
- **conv_last (nn.Conv2d)**: The final convolutional layer that outputs the super-resolved image.
- **pixel_shuffle (nn.PixelShuffle)**: A layer that rearranges elements in a tensor to increase spatial resolution.
- **lrelu (nn.LeakyReLU)**: A Leaky ReLU activation function used in the network.

### Methods

#### __init__(self, num_feat=64, num_block=15, spynet_path=None)
**Description**: Initializes the BasicVSR model with specified parameters.

- **Parameters**:
  - `num_feat (int)`: Number of channels for feature representation. Default is 64. (Range: positive integers)
  - `num_block (int)`: Number of residual blocks in each trunk. Default is 15. (Range: positive integers)
  - `spynet_path (str)`: Path to the pretrained weights of SPyNet. Default is None. (Range: string or None)

- **Return**: None

#### get_flow(self, x)
**Description**: Computes the optical flow between consecutive frames in the input tensor.

- **Parameters**:
  - `x (torch.Tensor)`: Input tensor of shape (b, n, c, h, w), where:
    - `b`: Batch size
    - `n`: Number of frames (temporal dimension)
    - `c`: Number of channels
    - `h`: Height of the frames
    - `w`: Width of the frames

- **Return**: 
  - `flows_forward (torch.Tensor)`: Optical flow from the current frame to the next frame, shape (b, n-1, 2, h, w).
  - `flows_backward (torch.Tensor)`: Optical flow from the next frame to the current frame, shape (b, n-1, 2, h, w).

#### forward(self, x)
**Description**: The forward pass of the BasicVSR model, which processes the input frames to produce super-resolved output frames.

- **Parameters**:
  - `x (torch.Tensor)`: Input frames with shape (b, n, c, h, w), where:
    - `b`: Batch size
    - `n`: Number of frames (temporal dimension)
    - `c`: Number of channels
    - `h`: Height of the frames
    - `w`: Width of the frames

- **Return**: 
  - `torch.Tensor`: A tensor containing the super-resolved frames, shape (b, n, 3, h*4, w*4).
