## Function: `generate`

### Description
The `generate` function takes a conditioning sequence (prompt) as input and continues to generate as many tokens as requested. It utilizes a language model to predict the next tokens based on the provided input.

### Parameters
- **model** (`LLaMA`): The language model to use for token generation.
  
- **idx** (`torch.Tensor`): A tensor of shape (T) containing indices of the prompt sequence. This tensor represents the input tokens for the model.

- **max_new_tokens** (`int`): The maximum number of new tokens to generate. This value should be a positive integer.

- **max_seq_length** (`Optional[int]`, default=None): The maximum sequence length allowed for the input to the model. If not specified, it defaults to the minimum of the current sequence length plus `max_new_tokens` and the model's block size.

- **temperature** (`float`, default=1.0): A scaling factor for the predicted logits. A higher temperature results in more random outputs, while a lower temperature makes the output more deterministic. Typical values are in the range (0.0, âˆž).

- **top_k** (`Optional[int]`, default=None): If specified, only samples among the tokens with the top `k` highest probabilities. This value should be a positive integer.

- **eos_id** (`Optional[int]`, default=None): If specified, the generation will stop once the end-of-sequence (EOS) token is triggered. This should be the index of the EOS token in the model's vocabulary.

### Returns
- **torch.Tensor**: A tensor containing the generated token indices. The shape of the returned tensor will be (T + max_new_tokens) if generation completes without triggering the EOS token, or it will be shorter if the EOS token is encountered.

### Purpose
The `generate` function is designed to facilitate the generation of text sequences based on a given prompt. It allows for customization of the generation process through parameters such as temperature and top-k sampling, enabling users to control the randomness and creativity of the output. The function is particularly useful in applications such as text completion, dialogue generation, and creative writing.
